Worklog:
14th March:
    * Figured the issue where Talos was unable to add peer node IPv4 CIDR route due to network being unreachable. It was due to blocking Tailscale ACL. I had to allow all the Talos cluster CIDRs in there. I also had to advertise and accept Tailscale routes on the nodes.

    * Failed to set up the cluster health Terraform check. It complains about unable to find one of the controlplane IPs in the k8s node spec.

    * Researched Flannel host-gw alternatives such as Calico with BGP and Cillium with native routing

19th March:
    * Add and refactor Talos Node Terraform module. I initially tried with Talos Cluster terraform module but it caused dependency issues with the OCI VM resources.

4th April:
    * Cloudflare tunnel intermittent 301 HTTP Error Code was resolved by setting Cloudflare SSL config from Flexible to Full to avoid redirects.
